The `MasterDetailsView` in this folder is normally found in the **UWP Community Toolkit**. However the current public release has a small issue in it that prevents it from rendering in the Visual Studio Designer.

I found the problem, applied a fix and and am using the modified version from here temporarily. 

I have shared the fix with the developer and they've checked in the fix. When it goes live, this will be replaced by the real one in `Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.UI.Controls`
